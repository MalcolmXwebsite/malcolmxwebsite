      <p>
We would rate this movie a 4,5 out of 5. We found the movie very good, but the start was not catchy enough for us to find the start interesting. And some of the scenes were very protracted, where they could be shortened and still have the same effect.</p>
<p>The movie made by Spike Lee is about Malcolm x¬¥s life. flashbacks from his childhood, till the day he was killed mid-speech. He was an activist for the rights of black people, he went through lots of stuff in order to make the black people get the rights he thought they deserved. His house was burned down, he was stalked by uncountable people. He received dead threads all day long, and at last, he was shot and killed mid-speech in Harlem, New York. </p>
